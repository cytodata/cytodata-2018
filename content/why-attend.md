As in previous years, CytoData brings together the community of researchers mining microscopy image data. This community has gained a lot of momentum over the last couple of years and shifted from proof-of-principle work to making biological discoveries. Collectively, we have gathered and continue to build on tremendous knowledge and insights into this challenging field!

We recently formed the CytoData society (CytoDS) to build and maintain an active community around image-based profiling of biological phenotypes induced by genetic, chemical or other perturbations of biological systems. CytoData 2018 will be great venue to connect with this community, exchange ideas, and learn from experts in the field.

Attendees will join together for a one-day symposium with seminars, lectures and social events followed by a two-day hackathon. We aspire to gather a diverse and engaged group of both, image-based profiling experts, and members of related fields. Everyone involved will be an active contributor (even if remote), no passive absorption of others’ ideas allowed! We assume participants will be willing to share their analysis strategies, given that each laboratory’s “competitive advantage” in this field does not come from their data pre-processing pipeline but rather from computational techniques downstream of the steps covered in the event, and from biological discoveries derived from their unique data.
