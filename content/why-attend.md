As in previous years ([2016](http://2016.cytodata.org), [2017](http://2017.cytodata.org)), CytoData brings together the community of researchers mining microscopy image data. This community has gained a lot of momentum over the last couple of years and shifted from proof-of-principle work to making biological discoveries. Collectively, we have gathered and continue to build on tremendous knowledge and insights into this challenging field!

We recently formed the CytoData Society ([CytoDS](http://society.cytodata.org)) to build and maintain an active community around image-based profiling of biological phenotypes induced by genetic, chemical or other perturbations of biological systems. CytoData 2018 will be great venue to connect with this community, exchange ideas, and learn from experts in the field.

Attendees will join together for a one-day symposium with seminars, lectures and social events followed by a two-day hackathon. We aspire to gather a diverse and engaged group of both image-based profiling experts, and members of related fields. Everyone involved will be an active contributor (even if remote), no passive absorption of others’ ideas allowed! We assume participants will be willing to share their analysis strategies, given that each laboratory’s “competitive advantage” in this field does not come from their data pre-processing pipeline but rather from computational techniques downstream of the steps covered in the event, and from biological discoveries derived from their unique data. 

**Fri Sep 21 Full day Symposium**
Hear from leading researchers in the field from industry and academia.

**Mon Sep 24 CytoData Hackathon - Day 1**  
Get oriented, and starting working on the first stage of the challenge.

**Tue Sep 25 CytoData Hackathon - Day 2**  
Refine models using second stage of the challenge, then evaluate on held out set. 
Winners will be announced based on the held out set.
