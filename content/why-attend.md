The world of image-based profiling harvests the rich information available in high throughput image assays. Over the last years, this research field changed from proof-of-principle to field that lead to many biological discoveries! Since our first hackathon in 2016, the world of image based profiling became even more exciting! We formed the CytoData Society with the focus on image based profiling to share and extend our enthusiasm and knowledge. In 2018, we again invite everyone from the novel student to the leading experts in this field to Boston. In our CytoData Symposium we have plenty of time to get in touch with this field, to learn from leading experts and to discuss and share our knowledge!

Scientists from the front lines of analyzing morphological data will be invited to our third CytoData Symposium, including postdocs, students, and staff scientists. Attendees will join together for a one-day symposium with seminars, lectures and social events followed by a two-day hackathon Boston. We aspire to gather a diverse and engaged group of both morphological profiling experts and members of related fields, such as alternate profiling methodologies. Everyone involved will be an active contributor (even if remote), no passive absorption of others’ ideas allowed! We assume participants will be willing to share their analysis strategies, given that each laboratory’s “competitive advantage” in this field does not come from their data pre-processing pipeline but rather from computational techniques downstream of the steps covered in the event, and from biological discoveries derived from their unique data. Given space limitations, we have limited the participation of the hackathon to researchers who are using microscopy images specifically for profiling – that is – using images to identify biologically relevant similarities and differences among perturbed samples.
