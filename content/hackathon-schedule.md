## Challenge format

**During the challenge: Sep 24 and 25, 2018**

The challenge will start with a description of the problem and a presentation of the datasets available for research. A summary of methodologies proposed before the challenge will be presented too. Teams will be formed after preliminary discussions and Q&A sessions. The data and other resources will be released when the teams are organized to start hacking.

Amazon Web Services virtual machines available for participants to run experiments. Also, example code to load data, run baseline experiments and evaluate performance will be provided to get partipants up to speed.

At the end of the two-day challenge, a holdout set will be released to participants to match image-based signatures in the sets provided before. This will be evaluated automatically to identify the team that can match signature across datasets more accurately than the baselines and other teams. 

The winning team will take a home a prize sponsored by Nvidia. 

**After the challenge: From Sep 26, 2018 onwards**

All the data generated during the challenge will be potentially useful to compare and analyze different strategies for solving the cross dataset matching problem. Interested participants can refine their approaches after the competition and contribute with their results in a collaborative paper written jointly with the challenge organizers and other participants.
