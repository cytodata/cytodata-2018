The CytoData society (CytoDS) is an international society that builds and maintains an active community around image-based profiling of biological phenotypes induced by genetic, chemical or other perturbations of biological systems. This field is still in its infancy, and its adoption has been slow, primarily due to the data analysis challenges posed, the large imaging experiments required, and the lack of ground-truth data sets where relationships among images are known. Our goal is therefore to bring image-based profiling into the mainstream by organizing the community working on this technology.

The [Carpenter Lab / Imaging Platform](https://www.broadinstitute.org/imaging) is based at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Our research group develops advanced methods and software tools to quantify and mine the rich information present in cellular images to yield biological discoveries. Our laboratory is best known for our open source software packages CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst, but a major focus these days is profiling: we are using advanced machine learning methods to identify morphological patterns in cell populations, to probe the causes and cures for disease.
