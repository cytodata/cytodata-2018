## Funding
Each participant should plan to finance their own travel and lodging (exception: some support can be provided for attendees from under-represented groups; please contact us at <cytodata.info@gmail.com>). 

## Transportation
The closest airport is Boston Logan Airport (BOS). The Broad Institute is accessible by the MBTA red line at the Kendall/MIT stop.

## Childcare Options
Hello Chime (by Sittercity): You can book online directly with babysitters; best for weekday (evening only) and the weekend.


There is also the possibility of on-site child care during the symposium if attendees would like it, but we need advance notice (min 3 weeks before event). If you're interested in this service, or have other questions regarding child care or if childcare expenses are a financial concern, please reach out to imagingadmin@broadinstitute.org.
